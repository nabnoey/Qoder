This file provides guidance to Qoder (qoder.com) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview
This is a minimal repository containing simple text files with Thai content. There are no build systems, package managers, or complex project configurations present.

## Current Structure
- `hello.txt` - Contains Thai greeting text
- `world.txt` - Contains Thai text about the world

## Development Environment
This repository does not require any specific development tools or build processes. Files can be edited directly with any text editor.

## Working with this Codebase
Since this is a simple text-based repository:
- No compilation or building is required
- No testing frameworks are configured
- No linting or formatting tools are set up
- Files can be modified directly

## Future Development Considerations
When adding new functionality to this repository, consider:
- What programming language or framework would be most appropriate
- Whether build tools or package managers should be introduced
- What testing strategy would be suitable
- How to structure the codebase as it grows in complexity
